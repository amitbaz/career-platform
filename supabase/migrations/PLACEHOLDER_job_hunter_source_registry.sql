-- Sources become an entity, and crawling follows measured novelty (issue #184).
--
-- PLACEHOLDER is deliberately not a timestamp. Migration timestamps are
-- allocated at pull-request open, in merge order (PR #202).

-- The source registry ------------------------------------------------------
--
-- Until now a source was a bare text label on a posting and a Python class
-- with a `source_label`. Two of this ticket's requirements need a row: a
-- source has a *kind*, and a source can oblige a surface to display
-- something.
--
-- `kind` exists because a licensed API is a first-class source kind and not
-- a variant of a crawl. Its rate accounting is a contractual quota of calls
-- rather than a politeness delay, its cadence is bounded by that call budget
-- rather than by how hard we dare hit it, and its rows overlap heavily with
-- scraped rows for the same posting -- which the fingerprint already handles.
-- Carrying `kind` from the start is what stops "source" from silently
-- meaning "crawl". No licensed source is enabled here; the shape is present
-- and the portfolio stays scraped.
--
-- `display_credit` is NOT called `attribution`. That word already means
-- market attribution throughout `discovery.py` -- `_cheap_market_attribution`,
-- `_record_reattribution`, `stats.reattributed_*` -- and a second meaning on
-- one word would be misread by everybody including us. "Credit" is the
-- licensing term of art and covers both halves of the obligation: the
-- required text and the required badge.
--
-- Shape of `display_credit`, written as the general rule rather than as one
-- provider's special case:
--
--   {"required": true,
--    "text": "Jobs by Adzuna",
--    "link_text": "Jobs",
--    "link_url": "https://...",
--    "badge_url": "https://.../logo.png",
--    "badge_min_px": [116, 23]}
--
-- A surface that cannot render `badge_url` -- Telegram's sendMessage has no
-- image entity -- contributes `text` and `link_url` and never the advert
-- body. #188 is where that is read.
--
-- This is shared *knowledge* in the #179 sense: what a source says is true
-- for everybody, so select is open to authenticated and every write is
-- revoked from every role a user can hold.
